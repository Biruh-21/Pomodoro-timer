# Pomodoro-timer
A python tkinter app to beat procrastination and improve your focus one pomodoro at a time. Pomodoro is Italian for 'tomato'.

The secret to effective time management is...thinking in tomatoes rather than hours? It may seem silly at first, but millions of people swear by the life-changing power to the Pomodoro Technique. (Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. üçÖ)

This popular time management method asks you to alternate pomodoros ‚Äî focused work sessions ‚Äî with frequent short breaks to promote sustained concentration and stave off mental fatigue.

Try the Pomodoro Technique if you...
<ul>
<li>Find little distractions often derail the whole workday</li>

<li>Consistently work past the point of optimal productivity</li>

<li>Have lots of open-ended work that could take unlimited amounts of time (e.g., studying for an exam, research for a blog post, etc.)</li>

<li>Are overly optimistic when it comes to how much you can get done in a day (aren't we all üôÉ)</li>

<li>Enjoy gamified goal-setting</li>

<li>Really like tomatoes</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>

The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.

Though Cirillo went on to write a 130-page book about the method,  its biggest strength is its simplicity:
<ol>
<li>Get a to-do list and a timer.</li>

<li>Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.</li>

<li>When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.</li>

<li>Then enjoy a five-minute break.</li>

<li>After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.</li>
</ol>
